Plastic is still a very small project, with a very small community of developers. 
Most features will need a dedicated developer to work on them. You are welcome to
open a feature request to discuss a feature before you begin work on it yourself.

If you aren't able to implement this feature yourself, take a minute to contemplate
how useful the feature would be to the broader community and the liklihoood it will
gain developer support on it's own. Otherwise, I suggest learning Swift yourself.
It's quite easy to learn and Apple provides hundreds of articles and videos to learn
from.
