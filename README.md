# Plastic
An iOS app for controlling Klipper-based 3d Printers using Moonraker
## This project is IN DEVELOPMENT
While the goal is to keep the `master` branch buildable at all times, this
project is NOT done. Feel free to install it but don't even expect every
button to work.

All the help in the world is wanted: from human interface work for the ui to graphic
design for the app's assets to serious coding to make the app stand up to
Apple's App Store review process. Learn [how to contribute](docs/contributing.md)

to propose an idea. 
## Preface
With the onset of moonraker-based interfaces for Klipper, the use of 
Octoprint and Octoprint api-based apps is dying. This project aims to 
be the a way to monitor and make adjustments to prints on your printer 
while being more elegant than loading a web-based ui in Safari.
